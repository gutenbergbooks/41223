<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">As over London Bridge I went</span>
<span class="i4">A constable I spied:</span>
<span class="i2">His head upon his breast was bent,</span>
<span class="i2">Against the parapet he leant,</span>
<span class="i2">He gazed upon the stream intent,</span>
<span class="i4">And as I passed he sighed.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"What ails thee, officer?" I cried</span>
<span class="i4">In sympathetic tone.</span>
<span class="i2">"What sorrow in thy soul is bred?</span>
<span class="i2">Nay, never shake thy mournful head,</span>
<span class="i2">But tell me of thy woes instead&mdash;</span>
<span class="i4">Thou shalt not weep alone."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He eyed me for a moment's space</span>
<span class="i4">In half-suspicious doubt;</span>
<span class="i2">But reading not a single trace</span>
<span class="i2">Of aught but pity in my face,</span>
<span class="i2">He told me of his hapless case</span>
<span class="i4">And poured his sorrows out.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Time was, not many months ago"&mdash;</span>
<span class="i4">His voice began to quiver&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">"When, in a stately march and slow,</span>
<span class="i2">The tide of traffic used to flow</span>
<span class="i2">In floods as full as that below"&mdash;</span>
<span class="i4">He pointed to the river.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"From early dawn to dewy night</span>
<span class="i4">It still blocked up the way:</span>
<span class="i2">The creaking wain, the hansom light,</span>
<span class="i2">The gaudy bus, in colours bright,</span>
<span class="i2">The gilded coach, the buggy slight,</span>
<span class="i4">And e'en the donkey-shay.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Amid the throng I took my stand,</span>
<span class="i4">I watched them come and go.</span>
<span class="i2">Anon the serried lines I scanned,</span>
<span class="i2">Anon I raised a warning hand,</span>
<span class="i2">And lo! at my supreme command</span>
<span class="i4">The flood forgot to flow!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"The bus, the cab, the coach, the fly,</span>
<span class="i4">Were motionless and still.</span>
<span class="i2">In all the crowds that passed me by</span>
<span class="i2">Was no one of degree so high</span>
<span class="i2">That dared my sovereignty defy,</span>
<span class="i4">Or disobey my will.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"The hansom hasting on her way</span>
<span class="i4">Paused when she heard my call.</span>
<span class="i2">The coster checked his donkey-shay,</span>
<span class="i2">The gartered lord his prancing bay&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">All, all were subject to my sway,</span>
<span class="i4">My word was law to all.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Alas! alas! 'tis thus no more!</span>
<span class="i4">Gone is my pride and power!</span>
<span class="i2">Where thousands passed in days of yore</span>
<span class="i2">Across the bridge, we've scarce a score,</span>
<span class="i2">For now the tides of traffic pour</span>
<span class="i4">Round by the busy Tower.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"And I am left to mourn alone</span>
<span class="i4">The glories that are fled.</span>
<span class="i2">None heed me now&mdash;alas! not one!</span>
<span class="i2">My life is lived! my day is done!</span>
<span class="i2"><i>Othello's</i> occupation's gone&mdash;</span>
<span class="i4">Ah! would that I were dead!"</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He ceased. The manly voice broke down.</span>
<span class="i4">I could no longer stay,</span>
<span class="i2">But, as I hurried off to town,</span>
<span class="i2">I pressed upon him half-a-crown,</span>
<span class="i2">And joyed to see the hopeless frown</span>
<span class="i4">Die for a while away.</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">I wonder, vaguely, where we met,</span>

<span class="i4">And whether I have left her yet</span>
<span class="i6">A permanently-injured heart;</span>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I begin to believe that I can do <i>no</i> wrong in
her eyes! (<i>Aloud.</i>) It was not altogether easy, believe me, to leave
without even having seen your face; but I felt so strongly that it was better so.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>looking down</i>). And&mdash;do you still feel that?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> I must confess that I am well content to have failed. It was such
unspeakable torture to think that you, Lady Maisie, <i>you</i> of all people,
would derive your sole idea of my personality from such an irredeemable
vulgarian as that veterinary surgeon&mdash;the man <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself, with an almost imperceptible start</i>). I
suppose it's only natural he should feel like that&mdash;but I wish&mdash;I <i>do</i>
wish he had put it just a little differently! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Poor Mr.
<span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>; perhaps he was not exactly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> Not <i>exactly!</i> I assure you, it is simply inconceivable to me
that, in a circle of any pretensions to culture and refinement, an
ill-bred boor like that could have been accepted for a single moment
as&mdash;I won't say a Man of <i>Genius</i>, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>the light dying out of her eyes</i>). No, <i>don't</i>&mdash;don't go
on, Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span>! We were all exceedingly stupid, no doubt, but you must
make allowances for us&mdash;for <i>me</i>, especially. I have had so few
opportunities of meeting people who are really distinguished&mdash;in
literature, at least. Most of the people I know best are&mdash;well, not
exactly <i>clever</i>, you know. I so often wish I was in a set that cared
rather more about intellectual things!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>with infinite pity</i>). How you must have pined for freer air!
How you must have starved on such mental provender as, for example, the
vapid and inane common-places of that swaggering carpet-soldier,
Captain&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thickset</span>, isn't it?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>drawing back into her corner</i>). You evidently don't know
that Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span> distinguished himself greatly in the Soudan,
where he was very severely wounded.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> Possibly; but that is scarcely to the point. I do not question
his efficiency as a fighting animal. As to his intelligence, perhaps,
the less said the better.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>contracting her brows</i>). Decidedly. I ought to have
mentioned at once that Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>
is a very old friend of mine.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> Really? <i>He</i>, at least, may be congratulated. But pray don't
think that I spoke with any personal animus; I merely happen to
entertain a peculiar aversion for a class whose profession is systematic
slaughter. In these Democratic times, when Humanity is advancing by
leaps and bounds towards International Solidarity, soldiers are such
grotesque and unnecessary anachronisms.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself, with a little shiver</i>). Oh, why does he&mdash;why
<i>does</i> he? (<i>Aloud.</i>) I should have thought that, until war itself is an
anachronism, men who are willing to fight and die for their country
could never be quite unnecessary. But we won't discuss Captain
<span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>, particularly now that he has left Wyvern. Suppose we go back
to Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>. I know, of course, that, in leaving him in ignorance as
you did, you acted from the best and highest motives; but still&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> It is refreshing to be so thoroughly understood! I think I know
what your "but still" implies&mdash;why did I not foresee that he would
infallibly betray himself before long? I <i>did</i>. But I gave him credit
for being able to sustain his part for another hour or two&mdash;until I had
gone, in fact.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Then you didn't wish to spare <i>his</i> feelings as
well as ours?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> To be quite frank, I didn't trouble myself about him; my sole
object was to retreat with dignity; he had got himself somehow or other
into a false position he must get out of as best he could. After all, he
would be none the worse for having filled My place for a few hours.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>slowly</i>). I see. It didn't matter to you whether he was
suspected of being an impostor, or made to feel uncomfortable, or&mdash;or
anything. Wasn't that a little unfeeling of you?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> Unfeeling! I allowed him to keep my evening clothes, which is
more than a good many&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> At all events, he may have had to pay more heavily than
you imagine. I wonder whether&mdash;&mdash; But I suppose anything so unromantic
as the love affairs of a veterinary surgeon would have no interest for you?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> Why not, Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>? To the Student
of Humanity, and still more to the Poet, the humblest love-story may have its
interesting&mdash;even its suggestive&mdash;aspect.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Well, I may tell you that it seems Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> has long
been attached, if not actually engaged, to a maid of mine.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>startled out of his self-possession</i>). You&mdash;you don't mean to
Miss <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> That <i>is</i> her name. How very odd that you&mdash;&mdash; But perhaps
Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> mentioned it to you last night?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>recovering his sang-froid</i>). I am hardly likely to have heard
of it from any other quarter.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Of course not. And did he tell you that she was here, in
this very house?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> No, he never mentioned <i>that</i>. What a singular coincidence!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Yes, rather. The worst of it is that the foolish girl
seems to have heard that he was a guest here, and jumped to the
conclusion that he had ceased to care for her; so she revenged herself
by a desperate flirtation with some worthless wretch she met in the
Housekeeper's Room, whose flattery and admiration, I'm very much afraid,
have completely turned her head!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>uncomfortably</i>). Ah, well, she must learn to forget him, and no
doubt, in time&mdash;&mdash; How wonderful the pale sunlight is on that yew hedge!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> You are not very sympathetic! I should not have told you
at all, only I wanted to show you that if poor Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> <i>did</i>
innocently usurp your place, he may have lost&mdash;&mdash; But I see all this
only bores you.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> Candidly, Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>, I can't affect a very
keen interest in the&mdash;er&mdash;gossip of the Housekeeper's Room. Indeed I am rather
surprised that <i>you</i> should condescend to listen to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). This is really <i>too</i> much! (<i>Aloud.</i>) It
never occurred to me that I was "condescending" in taking an interest in a pretty and wayward
girl who happens to be my maid. But then I'm not a Democrat,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> I&mdash;I'm afraid you construed my remark as a rebuke; which it was
not at all intended to be.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> It would have been rather uncalled for if it had been,
wouldn't it? (<i>Observing his growing uneasiness.</i>) I'm afraid you don't
find this bench quite comfortable?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> I&mdash;er&mdash;moderately so. (<i>To himself.</i>) There's a female
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> figure
coming down the terrace steps. It's horribly like&mdash;&mdash; But that must be
my morbid fancy; still, if I can get Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> away, just in case&mdash;&mdash;
(<i>Aloud.</i>) D&mdash;don't you think sitting still becomes a
little&mdash;er&mdash;monotonous after a time? Couldn't we&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 6em;">[<i>He rises, spasmodically.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>rising too</i>). Certainly; we have sat here quite long
enough. It is time we went back.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). We shall meet her! and I'm almost sure it's&mdash;&mdash; I
<i>must</i> prevent any&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Aloud.</i>) Not <i>back</i>, Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>! You&mdash;you
promised to show me the orchid-house&mdash;you did, indeed!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Very well; we can go in, if you care about orchids. It's
on our way back.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). This is too awful! It <i>is</i> that girl <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>.
She is looking for somebody! Me! (<i>Aloud.</i>) On second thoughts, I don't
think I <i>do</i> care to see the orchids. I detest them; they are weird
unnatural extravagant things. Let us turn back and see if there are any
snowdrops on the lawn behind that hedge. I love the snowdrop, it is so
trustful and innocent, with its pure green-veined&mdash;&mdash; <i>Do</i> come and
search for snowdrops!</p>

</div>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Not just now. I think&mdash;(<i>as she shields her eyes with one
hand</i>)&mdash;I'm not quite sure yet&mdash;but I rather fancy that must be my maid
at the other end of the walk.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). <i>I</i> assure you, Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>, you are quite mistaken.
Not the <i>least</i> like her!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>astonished</i>). Why, how can you possibly tell that,
without having seen her, Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> I&mdash;I meant&mdash;&mdash; You described her as "pretty," you know. This girl
is plain&mdash;distinctly plain!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I don't agree at all. However, it certainly is
<span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>, and she seems to have come out in search of me;
so I had better see if she has any message.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> She hasn't. I'm <i>positive</i> she hasn't. She&mdash;she wouldn't walk
like <i>that</i> if she had. (<i>In feverish anxiety.</i>) Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>, shall we
turn back? She&mdash;she hasn't seen us <i>yet!</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Really, Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span>! I don't quite see why I should run
away from my own maid!... What is it, Phillipson?</p>

<p style="margin-left: 6em;">[<i>She advances to meet</i> <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>,
   <i>leaving</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span> <i>behind, motionless.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). It's all over! That confounded girl recognises

I&mdash;I might stroll gently on and leave them; but it would look too like

won't give up just yet. (<i>He sinks limply upon the bench.</i>) After all,
I've been in worse holes than this since I came into this infernal

she will only give me five minutes alone, I <i>know</i> I can clear myself;

<p>Some people are disposed to deny to Mr. <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span>
a sense of humour. They will surely reconsider their judgment in view of the fact that the
late <span class="smcap">Premier</span> made the author of <i>Work and Wages</i>
(<span class="smcap">Longmans</span>) a Lord-in-waiting to the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>.
The volume contains in handy form a series of addresses and papers spoken and written by
Lord Brassey during the last quarter of a century. They disclose profound knowledge, not
only of the principles that underlie the connection between Work and Wages, but
of the everyday practices that sometimes control it. Throughout, the
book is marked by a broad spirit and statesmanlike view which, if more
common, would make strikes much more uncommon. As Mr. <span class="smcap">George Howell</span>
inhis introduction points out, when in 1869 the young member for Hastings
(not yet Lord <span class="smcap">Brassey</span>) addressed the House of Commons on the subject
ofTrade Unions there were very few members who knew anything about the
subject, except that they did not like it. Mr. <span class="smcap">Brassey</span>,
the son of one of the greatest employers of labour of the day, had the breadth of mind
to recognise the right of industrial organisation representing labour,
and lived to see the ban against trades unions removed by the House of
Commons. The book is, my Baronite says, the most valuable contribution
to the intricate question discussed of any recently published. Truly a
most remarkable work for an ex-lord-in-waiting. We shall next hear of
Mr. <span class="smcap">"Bobby" Spencer</span> coming out with a treatise
on the Solar Parallax.</p>

<p class="indent">"With delight," writes a young Baronite, "the ordinary schoolboy turns
from even Old <span class="smcap">Æsop's</span> words of wisdom to the ever-blissful fascinations
of cowboys, Red Indians, and all the untrammelled pleasures of ranch
life which are to be met with in following <i>The Great Cattle Trail</i>, by
<span class="smcap">Edward S. Ellis</span> (<span class="smcap">Cassell &amp; Co.</span>); and certainly life appears very, so
very interesting, when you can be a hero with Buffalo Bill effect."</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Five Stars in a Little Pool</i>, by <span class="smcap">Edith Carrington</span> (<span class="smcap">Cassell &amp; Co.</span>),
suggests lives and billiards, but that is the wrong cue to give, except
that it is five little stories in black on white, "red" is added when
you've finished the book.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Cassell &amp; Co.</span> evidently, or, says a Baronite fresh from school,
"<i>Ovid</i>ently" put a new construction on "<i>Ars est celare Artem</i>," for in
their <i>Magazine of Art</i> it is clearly shown not only what Art does but
how it does it. The etchings and photogravures are charming. There is a
capital article on stage costumes, and among them is found the original
idea out of which the fashionable Serpentine dance was twirlingly
evolved.</p>

<p class="indent">Most little people will be much amused by the waggish tale of <i>Toby</i>, by
<span class="smcap">Ascott R. Hope</span>. He is not of course <i>Mr. Punch's</i> "Toby," <i>cela va sans
dire</i>. There cannot be two Tobies. It is "Toby or not Toby," and there
is no "question" about it. This Toby, to whom <i>the</i> Toby never stood
godfather, gives us the benefit of his amusing opinions. He is brought
out by <span class="smcap">Innes (&amp; Co.)</span>, and is one of the daintiest dogs in the Dainty
Book Series. So much for <i>Toby</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Any who read the first series of <i>Eighteenth Century Vignettes</i>, by
<span class="smcap">Austin Dobson</span>, will eagerly welcome a second series issued by the same
publishers, Messrs. <span class="smcap">Chatto and Windus</span>. Of all writers at work to-day,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Austin Dobson</span> is most profoundly steeped in the literary essence of
the Eighteenth Century, and is most successful in reproducing its
flavour. In writing about <span class="smcap">Swift</span>, <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, Dr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>, or the
topography of <span class="smcap">Humphrey Clinker</span> (a learned, yet most mellow
disquisition), he does not condescend to the easily-acquired trick of
introducing archaic words, or inverting sections of phrases with which
we are familiar in the works of some other artists on the same broad
pavement. Yet, withal, there is in the literary style of these pleasant
chats round about the old writers, booksellers and bookbuyers, a certain
distinct Eighteenth Century flavour. So intimate is Mr. Dobson with the
ways, the personal appearance, the dress, the daily environment, and the
little gestures of the more or less mighty dead, that he is able to
recall them to startlingly vivid life. His picture of <span class="smcap">Swift</span> writing to
<span class="smcap">Stella</span> from his bed in the back room of a first floor in Bury Street,
St. James's, is a masterpiece of live portraiture.</p>

the sailors not yet marched to the capital? Because the soldiers and the
sailors have all got the fever. Why have they got the fever? Because our
neighbour is wicked. Does it rain like this every day? Yes, it rains
every day in the wet season. Which, then, is the dry season in the
island? There is no dry season in the island. It is right to live for
glory. There is much glory in shooting barbarians. When the island is
conquered, who will go and live in it? My tailor, my butcher, my wife's
mother (the mother of my wife), and all my creditors, I hope, will go
and live in it. We are not so rich as we once were. Why are we not so
rich as we once were? Because we have spent all our money in trying to
have big Colonies like our neighbour. If our neighbour is so wicked, why
should we imitate him? He is only wicked because he has (the) big
Colonies.</p>

<span class="smcap">Brown</span>, <span class="smcap">Jones</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Robinson</span> <i>discovered reading papers</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Brown.</i> Wonderful this war between China and Japan. And all arising out
of the Corea. By the way, where is the Corea?</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Jones.</i> Oh, close to Port Arthur. Haven't you seen the maps in the
paper?</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Brown.</i> Yes, but they begin, so to speak, in the middle. Of course I
know where the Corea is for about a hundred miles all round, but what's
beyond?</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Robinson</i> (<i>looking over the top of his paper</i>). I fancy Russia. That's
evidently why the Russians took such an interest in the row. You see, of
course, they want an entrance into the Mediterranean from the Black Sea,
and if the Corea were definitely annexed by the Japanese, what would
become of Sebastopol?</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Brown.</i> Why, you are thinking of the Crimea.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Robinson.</i> I suppose I am.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4em;">[<i>Resumes the reading of his paper.</i></p>
<p class="indent"><i>Jones.</i> But still the Russians do take an interest in the quarrel. Or
rather did; for, now that the Muscovites are on such excellent terms
with us, it doesn't much matter what happens.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Brown.</i> Of course not. Such good taste of the <span class="smcap">Czar</span> to make the Prince a
Colonel of the Kiel Hussars, and saying, too, that his bride was
English, not German. The new Emperor thoroughly appreciates the value of
an English alliance. And you see France, too, wants to join it.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Jones.</i> Then that will put everything right about Egypt, Madagascar,
and Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Robinson</i> (<i>emerging from his paper</i>). I never could see the use of the
Suez Canal. No more could Lord Palmerston. And couldn't we get to India
quite as quickly by the Pacific Railway?</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Brown</i> (<i>doubtfully</i>). I think not; although, of course, it shortens
the route to Australia. I fancy it wouldn't help us much with Egypt.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Jones.</i> Why, the Pacific Railway is in Canada&mdash;isn't it?</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Robinson.</i> I suppose it is.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4em;">[<i>Returns to the perusal of his paper.</i></p>
<p class="indent"><i>Brown.</i> Not that the Pacific Railway isn't useful. You see, the
Americans are waking up, and even proposed to intervene in the
Chino-Japanese controversy. That shows they have abandoned the old
policy of keeping themselves to themselves.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Jones.</i> Of course that's impossible. You see that while we are so
violently in favour of free trade, we must take an interest in
transatlantic politics.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Brown.</i> Yes, there is a good deal in what you say, and I suppose on
account of the fall in silver we all must be careful.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Robinson</i> (<i>emerging from his paper</i>). Perhaps it is connected with
bi-metallism.</p>

<h2>THE NOVELIST'S VADE MECUM.</h2>
<h4>(<i>Compiled by a Publisher with strong views on the Subject.</i>)</h4>

<p><i>Question.</i> Which do you prefer&mdash;a novel in three volumes, or in one
single tome?</p>
<p><i>Answer.</i> That is a matter that entirely depends upon terms.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Then you are indifferent as to length?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> In everything save the figures of a cheque.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> But is not Art your first consideration?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> Certainly, when it leads to a substantial balance at my bankers.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Then you write for your living?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> Certainly, or I shouldn't live at all.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Which do you prefer&mdash;a story produced in parts, or a story
published as a whole?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> Again a question of terms. Still, if remuneration is equal,
sketches of character are easier than construction of plot.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> When is the latter necessary?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> When the novel is written for a serial, and is published with the
standing announcement (frequently repeated), "to be continued in our
next."</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Is it difficult to sketch character?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> Not if you do not mind irritating your friends and driving your
foes into lunacy.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> How do you irritate your friends?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> By reproducing in an amusing manner their peculiarities.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> And how do you madden your foes?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> By passing them over in a dead silence, and sternly refusing to
recognise their existence.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> How should you treat your contemporaries?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> If you appreciate your work at its proper (that is to say, your
<i>own</i>) value, you will not admire contemporaries.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> And what will you say of authors of the past?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> That it is fortunate that they did live in the past, as they
certainly do not exist in the present, and will certainly not revive in
the future.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> How should you criticise a contemporary's novel?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> If you are sure of his influencing a criticism of your own work
favourably, praise his romance sky high. If he is, from a reviewer's
point of view, a negligable quantity, why, treat him on that basis.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Then what is your motto?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> "Nothing for nothing."</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Do you consider a novelist's life the best possible form of
existence?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> I should say yes if I did not know of a form of existence to be
even better.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> And what is that?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> Inheriting a fortune, putting your hands in your pockets, and for
the rest of your life doing nothing.</p>

<h2>THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.</h2>
<h4>IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Electioneering.</span></h4>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Whatever</span>, my wife may think about my public meeting, and whatever I may
feel about it myself, one thing is quite certain&mdash;that it has left
Mudford a very different village from what it found it. When I commenced
my great efforts in the cause of citizenship there was apathy and
ignorance amongst the "idiots"&mdash;as my friend Miss <span class="smcap">Phil. Burtt</span> insists on
calling the villagers. Things travel quickly nowadays, and at the
present moment we are all ablaze with the excitement of electioneering.</p>

<p class="indent">I ought to say at once that I have taken as yet no steps in my own
candidature. I feel that, after the part I have played in the great
Drama of Village Home Rule, the next move ought to come from a grateful
and appreciative peasantry. In point of fact, I have been expecting
every day, every hour almost, a deputation to ask me to allow myself to
be put in nomination&mdash;I fancy that's the correct phrase. So far the
deputations have been as conspicuous by their absence <i>since</i> the
meeting as they were annoying by their frequency <i>before</i>. Another
curious fact I have noticed in this. We are to have a Parish Council of
seven. Thus far I have heard of <i>exactly seven candidates and no more</i>.
This means that when I am nominated, as I shall be, of course, by all
sections of the community (for I feel in my inward heart that it will be
"all right on the night"), there will be only <i>one</i> candidate too many.
Who will be the unsuccessful one? I wonder!</p>

<p class="indent">Of the seven candidates, I should first mention Mrs. <span class="smcap">Letham Havitt</span> and
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Arble March</span>. Both of these ladies have started a vigorous campaign,
and&mdash;<i>mirabile dictu!</i> (it makes one feel so literary to introduce every
now and again a tag of Latin)&mdash;are running amicably together. At a
Parliamentary election it's a case of war to the knife, but now the lion
lies down with the lamb; not that, for one single instant, would I
insinuate that either is a lion, or, for the matter of that, a lamb. I
should be ashamed to be so familiar. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Havitt's</span> placards are
everywhere on the walls. The effect of contrasts is at times surprising.
For instance&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><b>Use Banana Soap</b></span><br />
<span class="smcap"><b>Letham Havitt</b></span><br />
<span class="smcap"><b>for the Parish Council.</b></span></p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. <span class="smcap">Arble March</span> is no less enterprising, and has purple appeals to you
to vote for "the March of Progress," and "the March of Ideas." It may be
very funny, but I have no patience with making a joke of such a serious
matter. No one, at any rate, can ever accuse me of being intentionally
funny.</p>

<p class="indent">It is announced from the Hall that the Squire has very kindly consented
to stand; the Vicar follows his neighbour's example, and will no doubt
be returned, if for nothing else, as a compliment to his two charming
daughters. (I think I must ask them to canvass for me when I come out.
My wife declares <i>she</i> won't, and that she won't let my girls either.)
That makes four candidates. The other three are <span class="smcap">Black Bob</span> and two of his
mates, who are claiming support as the "People's Three."</p>

<p class="indent">And now comes, perhaps, the most extraordinary thing of all&mdash;their
programme! I find that it is full of the most (so-called) advanced
ideas, but that the plank which seems to be the most attractive is "Free
Trout-fishing!" I confess I could hardly believe my own eyes when I read
it. In the first place, it seemed so farcical. In the second place, the
only trout-fishing in the neighbourhood happens to <i>belong</i> to <span class="smcap">me</span>!
What's more, I don't see any way out of the difficulty. I met <span class="smcap">Black Bob</span>
a day or two ago and asked him how he ever got such an absurd notion
into his head that the Parish Council had anything to do with
trout-fishing. "It's all right, Mr. <span class="smcap">Winkins</span>," said he, "just remember
what Section 8 says." I said nothing at the time, because I thought as a
fact that that section referred to Boards of Guardians. When I looked at
the Act, sure enough I read, as being one of the powers possessed by the
Parish Council&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 6em;">"(<i>e</i>) <i>To utilise any</i> well, spring, or
<i>stream within their parish</i>"....</p>

<p class="indent">I read no more. I had read enough. How any Parliament can ever have
dared to insert such a monstrous section I cannot understand. But there
it is. "Free trout-fishing!" Well&mdash;there ought to be someone on the
Parish Council to defend the rights of property. I shall be the man.</p>

cannot fail to be an eventful night.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Let me collect my scattered senses! Where am I? In Pitti Palace. On
narrow staircase. Probably on forbidden ground. I hear
footfall&mdash;descending. Perhaps it may be one of the officials, and I
shall be caught in the act of attempting to enter the royal attics! What
would be the punishment? Death, or penal servitude? The gallows or the
galleys? Have happily several one-lira notes in my pocket. If these are
not sufficient, five lire, or even ten&mdash;&mdash; But I shall see what sort of
man he is. Perhaps a few coppers would be enough. At this moment the
obstruction descends, and I discover that he is a fat German tourist.
For the first time in my life am pleased to look at a German, though the
cut of this one's clothes is even worse than usual. Feel inclined to
fall upon his neck and murmur "<i>Mahlzeit!</i>" or "<i>Prosit!</i>" or some other
idiotic exclamation peculiar to his country. Fortunately, remember that
these are only said in connection with eating or drinking. Perhaps, if I
were to remind him of drink, after he has spent hours in a dry, hot
gallery, it would not tend to conciliate him. Therefore muster up the
half-dozen words of his awful language which years of anxious study have
enabled me to master in all their complexities of gender, number, case,
declension, conjugation, agreement, government, &amp;c.&mdash;not forgetting the
exceptions&mdash;and, taking off my hat, ask him if this is the entrance to
the galleries. "<i>Ja wohl</i>," says he. And moreover if I go up these
stairs to the top. "<i>Ja wohl</i>," says he again. Emboldened by his
courteous affability, I remark that the staircase is very narrow. "<i>Ja
wohl</i>," says he, for the third time, and passes on. A very interesting
conversation with an intelligent foreigner in a country where we are
both strangers. There is nothing like travel to enlarge the mind.
Besides, one learns so much of foreign languages when one hears the
varied idioms and phrases of the natives.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus meditating I arrive at the top of the ladder. What a smell of
paint! They are evidently doing up the palace. Turn along a passage
about two feet wide&mdash;how that German got through it has puzzled me ever
since&mdash;and find myself in a magnificent studio, filled with painters,
easels, palettes and canvases, and with the smell of paint. That German
deceived me. I have come to the wrong place after all. Am just about to
apologise and retreat when I perceived a fine old master on the wall.
Peeping amongst the painters, easels, palettes, and canvases, perceive
other old masters, almost entirely hidden by the various erections of
the students. At this moment an official rings a small bell. Ask him if
I may be permitted to look at some of the pictures on the walls, if it
would not be interfering with the painters. "Certainly, <i>signore</i>," says
he. And ask him where the Pitti Gallery is. "It is here," says he. What?
I have reached it at last! But how can one see anything when the whole
place is choked up with these execrable modern copies and the apparatus
to support them? However, I will see what I can now that I have got
here. Happily the daylight will last for at least another hour. "But,"
continues the official, as I meditate, "it is now four o'clock. The
gallery is closed."</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Delightful news! My sister <span class="smcap">Nellie</span> is engaged to be married!
It came upon us all as a great surprise. I never had the slightest
suspicion that <span class="smcap">Nellie</span> cared twopence about old
<span class="smcap">Goodbody St. Leger.</span> He is
such a staid, solemn old party, a regular fossilised bachelor we all
thought. Not at all the sort of man to give way to emotions or to be in
love. However, it's a capital match for <span class="smcap">Nellie</span> as <span class="smcap">St. Leger's</span> firm are
about the largest accountants in the city. My wife thinks it will be a
good thing in another way, too, as my other six sisters may now have a
chance of going off. It seems that when once this kind of epidemic gets
into a family, all the unmarried sisters go popping off like blazes one
after another. Called with my wife this afternoon to congratulate
<span class="smcap">Nellie</span>. Rather a trial for the poor girl, as all sorts of female
relatives had called full of enthusiasm and congratulations. <span class="smcap">Goodbody</span>
was there (<span class="smcap">Nellie</span> calls him "<span class="smcap">Goodie</span>") and seemed rather overwhelmed. He
went away early and didn't kiss <span class="smcap">Nellie</span>. I thought this funny, and
chaffed Nellie about it afterwards. She said she'd soon make that all
right.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Goodbody</span> is getting on. We had a family dinner at home
to-night. He came rather late and entered the drawing-room with an air
of great determination, marched straight up to <span class="smcap">Nellie</span> and kissed her
violently. It was splendidly done and we all felt inclined to cheer. He
kissed her again when he went away, and lingered so long in saying good
night to my mother that we all thought he was going to kiss her too. But
he didn't. My wife said that the suspense of those moments was dreadful.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;He has kissed my mother&mdash;on both cheeks. I must say the
old lady took it extraordinarily well, though she was not in the very
least prepared for it. It happened at five o'clock tea, in an interval
of complete silence, and those two sounding smacks simply reverberated
through the room. Mother was quite cheerful afterwards, and spoke to
<span class="smcap">Nellie</span> about the trousseau in her usual calm and collected frame of
mind. Still I can see that the incident has made a deep impression upon
her. My wife told <span class="smcap">Maggie</span> it would be her turn next.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;It <i>has</i> been <span class="smcap">Maggie's</span> turn. Goodbody called at home on his
way from the City, and set to work as soon as he got into the
drawing-room. He first kissed <span class="smcap">Nellie</span>, then repeated the performance with
my poor mother, and, finding that <span class="smcap">Maggie</span> was close beside him, he kissed
her on the forehead. Where will this end?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;He has regularly broken loose. He dined at home to-day, and,
without a word of warning, kissed the whole family&mdash;my mother, <span class="smcap">Nellie</span>,
<span class="smcap">Maggie, Alice, Mabel, Polly, Maud</span>, and little <span class="smcap">Beta</span>. He quite forgot he
had begun with my mother, and, after he had kissed <span class="smcap">Beta</span>, got confused,
and began all over again. At this moment my wife and I came in with Aunt
<span class="smcap">Catherine</span> whom we had brought in our carriage. Both my wife and Aunt
<span class="smcap">Catherine</span> tried to escape, but it was no good. He kissed them both, and
was just advancing towards me, when the butler fortunately announced
dinner. Matters are getting quite desperate, and we none of us know what
ought to be done. Aunt <span class="smcap">Catherine</span> had a violent fit of hysterics in the
spare bedroom after dinner.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;The engagement is broken off. A great relief. It has been a
lesson for all of us.</p>
